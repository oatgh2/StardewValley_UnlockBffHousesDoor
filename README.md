# 🔑 Stardew NPC Keys Mod

A **Stardew Valley (SMAPI)** mod that allows NPCs to grant the player a key to their house when friendship reaches **8 or more hearts**, unlocking access outside normal hours.

This project was designed to be **educational, extensible, and a solid technical base** for developers who want to learn how to create clean, well-structured mods using C#, SMAPI and Harmony.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ NPCs grant their house key at 8+ hearts
- ✅ Free access to NPC homes at any time
- ✅ Persistent storage via `modData`
- ✅ Precise patch on `GameLocation.lockedDoorWarp`
- ✅ Modular architecture using `EventsManipulator`
- ✅ Native multiplayer support
- ✅ Compatible with custom NPCs from other mods
- ✅ Optional debug logging

## 🧠 How it works

### 1. Key Grant System
At the start of each in-game day (`GameLoop.DayStarted`), the mod:

1. Iterates through all farmers
2. Checks friendship with each NPC
3. If friendship >= 8 hearts, the NPC key is registered
4. The key is stored in `farmer.modData`

```csharp
if (hearts >= 8 && !givedKeys.Contains(npcName))
    givedKeys.Add(npcName);
```

---

### 2. Door Unlock (Harmony Patch)
The default game behavior is intercepted using Harmony:

```csharp
[HarmonyPatch(typeof(GameLocation), "lockedDoorWarp")]
[HarmonyPrefix]
public static bool Prefix(...)
```

If the player owns the NPC key, the method manually performs the door opening logic and skips the original:

```csharp
Game1.warpFarmer(locationName, tile.X, tile.Y, false);
return false;
```

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

This project follows a clean and modular structure designed for maintainability and easy learning:

```
ModEntry.cs

Events/
 ├── EventsManipulator.cs
 └── WorldEvents.cs

Harmony/
 └── GameLocationHarmony.cs

Utils/
 ├── Utils.cs
 └── StringfiedList.cs
```

### Structure Explanation

- **ModEntry.cs**  
  Main entry point of the mod. It initializes Harmony patches and dynamically registers all event modules.

- **Events/**  
  Contains all classes responsible for managing game events. Each module inherits from `EventsManipulator` and is automatically discovered via reflection.

- **Harmony/**  
  All Harmony patches are isolated here, including the interception of `lockedDoorWarp` to control door access.

- **Utils/**  
  Shared helper utilities and data processing tools used across the mod.
